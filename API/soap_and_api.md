## REST and SOAP are two different approaches to exchanging data over the internet, and they differ in several ways, including:

### Structure

SOAP is highly structured and uses XML, while REST is more flexible and can use multiple formats.

### Performance

REST is less CPU intensive and performs better than SOAP. SOAP messages can be large and use a lot of bandwidth, which can slow down performance.

### Security

SOAP has built-in security with WS Security, while REST doesn't have built-in security and relies on API design.

### Ease of use

REST is simpler and easier to set up than SOAP.

### Design

REST is a set of architectural principles, while SOAP is an official protocol.

### Use cases

REST is designed for mobile applications and lightweight web services, while SOAP was designed to allow applications built on different platforms and languages to communicate.

### Caching

REST supports caching on the client and server sides, which can improve API performance.
