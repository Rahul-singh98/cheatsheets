3. How do you declare variables in Go?
   Variables in Go can be declared in several ways:

   ```go
   var name string
   var age int = 30
   x := 10 // Short declaration, type inferred
   ```

4. What is the difference between `var` and `:=` in Go?
   `var` is used for explicit variable declarations, while `:=` is used for short variable declarations with type inference. `:=` can only be used inside functions, whereas `var` can be used both inside and outside functions.

5. How do you create a slice in Go?
   Slices can be created in multiple ways:

   ```go
   slice1 := []int{1, 2, 3}
   slice2 := make([]int, 5)
   slice3 := arr[1:4] // Creating a slice from an array
   ```

6. What is a package in Go?
   A package in Go is a collection of source files in the same directory that are compiled together. It's a way to organize and reuse code. Every Go program starts running in the `main` package.

7. How do you handle errors in Go?
   Go uses explicit error handling. Functions that can produce an error return an `error` type as their last return value. Errors are checked using if statements:

   ```go
   result, err := someFunction()
   if err != nil {
       // Handle error
   }
   ```

8. What is the purpose of the `defer` keyword?
   The `defer` keyword is used to schedule a function call to be run after the function completes. It's often used for cleanup operations:

   ```go
   defer file.Close()
   ```

9. How do you create a function in Go?
   Functions in Go are declared using the `func` keyword:

   ```go
   func add(x int, y int) int {
       return x + y
   }
   ```

10. What is a goroutine?
    A goroutine is a lightweight thread managed by the Go runtime. It's started by using the `go` keyword before a function call:
    ```go
    go someFunction()
    ```

## Intermediate Level

11. Explain the difference between arrays and slices in Go.
    Arrays in Go have a fixed size, while slices are dynamic and can grow or shrink. Arrays are value types, while slices are reference types that point to an underlying array.

12. What are channels in Go and how are they used?
    Channels are a typed conduit through which you can send and receive values with the channel operator `<-`. They are used for communication and synchronization between goroutines:

    ```go
    ch := make(chan int)
    go func() { ch <- 42 }()
    value := <-ch
    ```

13. How does Go handle concurrency?
    Go uses goroutines for concurrent execution and channels for communication between goroutines. This model, known as Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP), allows for efficient and safe concurrent programming.

14. What is the purpose of the `init()` function?
    The `init()` function is used for initialization. It's called automatically before the `main()` function in a package. Each file can have multiple `init()` functions, and they're executed in the order they appear in the file.

15. How do you implement interfaces in Go?
    In Go, interfaces are implemented implicitly. A type implements an interface by implementing its methods:

    ```go
    type Writer interface {
        Write([]byte) (int, error)
    }

    type File struct{}

    func (f File) Write(data []byte) (int, error) {
        // Implementation
    }
    ```

16. What is a pointer in Go and how is it used?
    A pointer holds the memory address of a value. Pointers are denoted by the `*` symbol:

    ```go
    x := 10
    ptr := &x  // ptr is a pointer to x
    *ptr = 20  // Dereference ptr to change x
    ```

17. Explain the concept of method receivers in Go.
    Method receivers in Go allow you to define methods on types. There are two types of receivers: value receivers and pointer receivers:

    ```go
    type Circle struct {
        radius float64
    }

    func (c Circle) Area() float64 {
        return 3.14 * c.radius * c.radius
    }

    func (c *Circle) SetRadius(r float64) {
        c.radius = r
    }
    ```

18. How do you handle panics in Go?
    Panics can be handled using the `recover()` function inside a deferred function:

    ```go
    defer func() {
        if r := recover(); r != nil {
            fmt.Println("Recovered from panic:", r)
        }
    }()
    ```

19. What is the difference between buffered and unbuffered channels?
    Unbuffered channels block the sender until the receiver is ready. Buffered channels can hold a limited number of values without a receiver being ready:

    ```go
    unbuffered := make(chan int)
    buffered := make(chan int, 10)
    ```

20. How does garbage collection work in Go?
    Go uses a concurrent mark-and-sweep garbage collector. It runs concurrently with the program, minimizing stop-the-world pauses. The collector identifies and frees memory that's no longer in use by the program.

## Advanced Level

21. Explain the concept of reflection in Go.
    Reflection in Go allows programs to examine, modify and create types, interfaces, structs, and functions at runtime. It's implemented using the `reflect` package:

    ```go
    t := reflect.TypeOf(x)
    v := reflect.ValueOf(x)
    ```

22. What are Go modules and how do they work?
    Go modules are the official dependency management system for Go. They allow you to specify and version dependencies, ensuring reproducible builds. A `go.mod` file in the project root defines the module and its dependencies.

23. How does Go's context package work?
    The `context` package provides a way to carry deadlines, cancellation signals, and other request-scoped values across API boundaries and between processes. It's commonly used for controlling cancellation in concurrent programs:

    ```go
    ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 5*time.Second)
    defer cancel()
    ```

24. Explain the empty interface (`interface{}`) and its uses.
    The empty interface `interface{}` has no methods and is satisfied by any type. It's used when you want to handle values of unknown type, similar to `Object` in Java or `void*` in C:

    ```go
    func PrintAny(v interface{}) {
        fmt.Println(v)
    }
    ```

25. What is a closure in Go and how is it used?
    A closure is a function value that references variables from outside its body. It can be used to create function factories or to emulate object-oriented patterns:

    ```go
    func adder() func(int) int {
        sum := 0
        return func(x int) int {
            sum += x
            return sum
        }
    }
    ```

26. How does Go handle race conditions?
    Go provides tools to detect and prevent race conditions:

    - The `-race` flag can be used with `go test`, `go run`, or `go build` to detect race conditions at runtime.
    - Channels and mutexes (`sync.Mutex`) are used to safely coordinate access to shared resources.

27. Explain the concept of embedding in Go structs.
    Embedding in Go allows you to include one struct within another, providing a form of composition:

    ```go
    type Animal struct {
        Name string
    }

    type Dog struct {
        Animal
        Breed string
    }
    ```

28. What are the best practices for error handling in Go?
    Some best practices for error handling in Go include:

    - Always check returned errors
    - Use custom error types for more specific error handling
    - Wrap errors to add context using `fmt.Errorf()` with `%w` verb
    - Use `errors.Is()` and `errors.As()` for error comparison and type assertion

29. How does Go's scheduler work with goroutines?
    Go uses a work-stealing scheduler that runs in user space. It manages goroutines across multiple OS threads, efficiently distributing work and maximizing CPU utilization. The scheduler uses a FIFO queue for each processor and can move goroutines between threads to balance load.

30. Explain the difference between `make()` and `new()` functions.
    - `new(T)` allocates zeroed storage for a new item of type T and returns its address (a `*T` value).
    - `make(T, args)` creates slices, maps, and channels only, and returns an initialized (not zeroed) value of type T (not `*T`).

## Expert Level

31. How does Go's memory model work?
    Go's memory model specifies the conditions under which reads of a variable in one goroutine can be guaranteed to observe values produced by writes to the same variable in a different goroutine. It ensures that goroutines and channels provide clear synchronization points for sharing memory.

32. Explain the concept of escape analysis in Go.
    Escape analysis is a compile-time process that determines whether a variable's lifetime extends beyond the function it's allocated in. Variables that "escape" are allocated on the heap, while others can be safely allocated on the stack, improving performance.

33. What are the performance implications of using interface{} vs concrete types?
    Using `interface{}` can lead to performance overhead due to type assertions and reflection. Concrete types are generally faster as they allow for static dispatch and better compiler optimizations. However, `interface{}` provides more flexibility when dealing with unknown types.

34. How does Go handle stack vs heap allocation?
    Go's compiler uses escape analysis to determine whether to allocate variables on the stack or heap. Stack allocation is faster but limited in size, while heap allocation is more flexible but requires garbage collection. The compiler aims to stack-allocate variables when possible for better performance.

35. Explain the concept of type assertions and type switches in Go.
    Type assertions provide access to an interface value's underlying concrete value:

    ```go
    value, ok := someInterface.(ConcreteType)
    ```

    Type switches allow you to compare a type against multiple types:

    ```go
    switch v := i.(type) {
    case int:
        fmt.Println("Integer:", v)
    case string:
        fmt.Println("String:", v)
    default:
        fmt.Println("Unknown type")
    }
    ```

36. How does Go's defer statement work under the hood?
    When a `defer` statement is executed, the function call and its arguments are evaluated immediately, but the actual function execution is deferred until the surrounding function returns. Deferred calls are pushed onto a stack, so they are executed in last-in-first-out order.

37. What are some advanced concurrency patterns in Go?
    Advanced concurrency patterns in Go include:

    - Worker pools
    - Fan-out, fan-in
    - Pipelines
    - Rate limiting
    - Context for cancellation and timeouts
    - Semaphores using weighted channels

38. How does Go's compiler optimize code?
    Go's compiler performs various optimizations, including:

    - Inlining of small functions
    - Escape analysis for efficient memory allocation
    - Dead code elimination
    - Constant propagation and folding
    - Loop unrolling
    - Bounds check elimination

39. Explain the concept of generics in Go (introduced in Go 1.18).
    Generics allow you to write functions and data structures that work with any type, while still maintaining type safety. They are implemented using type parameters:

    ```go
    func Print[T any](s []T) {
        for _, v := range s {
            fmt.Println(v)
        }
    }
    ```

40. How does Go's runtime handle goroutine scheduling in detail?
    Go's runtime uses a work-stealing scheduler with the following characteristics:
    - M:N scheduling model (M goroutines on N OS threads)
    - Each P (processor) has a local run queue of goroutines
    - Global run queue for overflow
    - Work-stealing algorithm to balance load across Ps
    - Preemptive scheduling based on function calls and loop back-edges
    - Cooperative scheduling for system calls and channel operations
